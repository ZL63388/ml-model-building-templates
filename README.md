## Machine Learning Model: Model Building Templates

#### This repository is a collection of both basic and advanced code templates for Model Building
#### All codes I am sharing are from the practical exercises I did from the Data Science Infinity Program

#### You are free to fork this repository

## Will continue to update this repository as I'm still completing the program as of July 8, 2021
#### To be added soon once completed:
##### - Random Forests Classification Basic
##### - Random Forests Classification Advanced
##### - K-Nearest-Neighbours (KNN) for Classification
##### - Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning
##### - Automating Workflows with Pipelines
##### - Causal Impact Analysis
##### - Machine Learning Model Deployment
